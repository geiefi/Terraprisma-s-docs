      <h1>Ripple</h1>

      <p>
        This is a utility component that is useful when you want to make
        something clickable. All it does is add an additional click event
        listener on its child and then render on the <code>body</code> of the{' '}
        <b>website</b> a list of ripples that are created each time the element
        is clicked.
      </p>

      <p>
        This component also does a few other things, like adjusting the radius
        of the wrapper of a ripple, or updating its positioning that I won't go
        into detail.
      </p>

      <h2>Usage</h2>

      <p>
        This is not a hard component to use, it is one of which I am the
        proudest with on DX.
      </p>

      <p>
        All you need to do is wrap your element with the{' '}
        <code>{'<Ripple>'}</code> and it will magically work. It will not even
        mess around with the positioning of the child element, it makes no
        difference in the layout at the end.
      </p>

          It is also good to note that besides the bellow props, all of the html
          attributes available for a <code>{'<div></div>'}</code> element are
          also availalbe for this component.

                  Each Ripple that is created on click of an element has a
                  wrapper so that we can do proper positioning of the ripple,
                  this forces us to have a prop llike this to still allow for
                  flexibility where the Ripple may be used.

                  By default, the Ripple will be colored as a opaque version of
                  the <code>[color]-bg</code> variant of the choosen{' '}
